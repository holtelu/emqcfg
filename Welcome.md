# What is it? #

This is an Eclipse text based WebSphere MQ environment configuration editor.

It uses [oAW](http://www.openarchitectureware.org) Xtext to define a DSL describing MQ environments.
With a concrete model you can generate all artifacts (scripts, documentation) needed to create the environment.
