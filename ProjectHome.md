# What is it? #

This is an Eclipse text based WebSphere MQ environment configuration editor.

It uses [TMF XText](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext) to define a DSL describing MQ environments.
With a concrete model you can generate all artifacts (scripts, documentation) needed to create the whole environment (queue manager, cluster, channels, listener, etc.).
